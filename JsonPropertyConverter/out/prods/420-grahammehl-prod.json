Rather than simply grinding the whole grain wheat kernel (bran, germ, and endosperm), in roller-milled graham flour the components are ground separately. The endosperm is ground finely, initially creating a fresh unbleached yellowish-white flour. The bran and germ are ground coarsely. The two parts are then recombined, creating a coarse-textured flour that bakes and keeps well (has a good shelf life) (1).","linked-id":"403","origins":"Schweiz,Spanien,Niederlande","name":"Grahammehl","alternatives":"403,421,422,423","delete":false,"standard-origin":"Schweiz","comments":"Different grinding process compared to wheat flower, different allocation needed as end product is a mix again of all grain parts.
