XML to JSON Converter
=====================

Converts a single FileMaker exported XML file to multiple JSON output files. All output file names follow the same naming convention: <code><id>-&lt;name&gt;-edb.json</code>. Both input and output files are expected to have a UTF-8 encoding, but this can be specified as a parameter.
